# Pygen Rewrite - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for the Pygen rewrite. Each phase builds on the previous one and delivers incremental value while maintaining the ability to test and validate progress.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Iterative Development**: Build in phases, test continuously
2. **Minimum Viable Product First**: Get basic functionality working before adding complexity
3. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
4. **Documentation Alongside Code**: Document as we build
5. **Regular Integration**: Merge frequently to avoid large integration efforts
6. **Validation Gates**: Each phase must pass criteria before moving to next

## Phase Overview

**Note**: Foundation already exists in the repository. This phase focuses on organization for parallel development.

### Tasks

   - Move existing Pygen v1 code to `cognite/pygen/legacy/` folder. However, keep the top-level `cognite/pygen/__init__.py` for v1 installation.
   - Move existing tests to `tests/legacy/` folder.
   - Keep v1 functional during v2 development
   - Set up new v2 structure alongside legacy

2. **Development Environment Validation**
   - Verify existing development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline works for dual structure
   - Update pre-commit hooks for new structure

3. **Testing Infrastructure Enhancement**
   - Validate existing pytest configuration
   - Ensure coverage reporting works with new structure
   - Enhance test fixtures and utilities

4. **Documentation Structure**
   - Validate existing documentation setup
   - Plan migration guide structure

### Deliverables
- ✅ V1 code moved to cognite/pygen/legacy/
- ✅ CI/CD works
- ✅ Test infrastructure supports parallel development

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Can format code with `ruff format`
- ✅ Can check types with `mypy`
- ✅ Coverage reporting works
- ✅ V1 remains functional in legacy folder

### Migration Plan
- ✅ Keep v1 in cognite/pygen/legacy/ until v2 is complete
- Delete cognite/pygen/legacy/  folder only after v2.0.0 release
- Maintain v1 bug fixes if critical during development

### Status
**✅ PHASE 0 COMPLETE** (December 20, 2025)

All tasks, deliverables, and success criteria have been met. The project is ready to proceed to Phase 1.

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Lazy Evaluation Complexity**

   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate, extensive testing

2. **Performance Targets**
   - **Risk**: May not achieve desired performance
   - **Mitigation**: Early benchmarking, continuous profiling, set realistic targets

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - **Risk**: Users may struggle to migrate
   - **Mitigation**: Good documentation, migration tools, deprecation period

4. **Multi-Language Support**
   - **Risk**: May be more complex than anticipated
   - **Mitigation**: Start with one additional language, learn, iterate

5. **Timeline Overruns**
   - **Risk**: Project may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer time, prioritize ruthlessly, MVP approach

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly progress reviews
- **Adjust Scope**: Be willing to cut features if timeline at risk
