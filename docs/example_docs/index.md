# Example Documentation

This Section contains example documentation for SDKs generated with `pygen`.

* `Omni`: This is a data model designed to cover all functionality of the CDF Data Models.
* `Windmill`: This is the example SDK used in the usage section.
* `CogniteCore`: This is the SDK generated for the Cognite Core Model.

The intention of this documentation is to show what methods, fields, and classes that are
