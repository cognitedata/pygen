## [0.2.1] - 24-04-23

### Fixed

* Fixed a problem with reading annotations caused by reverse ordering of dataclasses (forward refs).


## [0.2.0] - 19-04-23

### Added

* Support for converting from `.graphql` to `pydantic`. This means you can now write your types in a `.graphql` file
  and automatically generate the `pytandic` counterpart.
* CLI for doing the conversion between GraphQL and `pydantic`. The following two commands
  * `dm togql` converts a pydantic schema to `.graphql` and creates the `client.py` which is the SDK to interact
    with the data model through Python.
  * `dm topython` converts a `.graphql` to `pytandic` classes. This command also creates the `client.py`, i.e., the
    SDK to interact with the data model through Pytho
* Documentation of motivation and usage of package.

### Changed

* CLI command going from `gqlpygen` to `pygen`. This is for ease of use.
