        Args:
            name: The name to filter on.
            name_prefix: The prefix of the name to filter on.
            external_id_prefix: The prefix of the external ID to filter on.
            space: The space to filter on.
            limit: Maximum number of fields to return.
                Defaults to 25. Set to -1, float("inf") or None to return all items.
            filter: (Advanced) If the filtering available in the above is not sufficient,
                you can write your own filtering which will be ANDed with the filter above.
            sort_by: The property to sort by.
            direction: The direction to sort by, either 'ascending' or 'descending'.
            sort: (Advanced) If sort_by and direction are not sufficient, you can write your own sorting.
                This will override the sort_by and direction. This allowos you to sort by multiple fields and
                specify the direction for each field as well as how to handle null values.

        Returns:
            List of requested fields

        Examples:

            List fields and limit to 5:

                >>> from field.client import FieldClient
                >>> client = FieldClient()
                >>> fields = client.field.list(limit=5)
